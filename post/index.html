      <p>
        Middle Seat was thrilled to join John Fetterman’s campaign for the U.S. Senate from the very beginning. We’re so proud of our team’s hard work to build such a groundbreaking, successful digital program and are so grateful to have been a part of their incredible campaign team.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Wayyyyy</i> back in <strong>November 2020</strong>, Middle Seat officially began working with John Fetterman and senior advisors (like communications expert Rebecca Katz) to begin building a winning grassroots campaign. We worked closely together for two years, from pre-launch planning through prevailing in a crowded primary and on to Election Night victory.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here’s how Middle Seat drove this critical win:
      </p>

      <h3>
        1. We built the infrastructure *long before* Day 1.
      </h3>

      <p>
        <a href="">John Fetterman</a> had a following from his successful 2018 campaign for Lieutenant Governor, and he grew that following even more after the 2020 election, when he generated a huge amount of earned media by debunking Donald Trump and the GOP’s election denier lies.
      </p>

      <p>
        This was a foundation upon which we could start building a successful U.S. Senate campaign — but it was still only a foundation. So, before the campaign even launched, Middle Seat assembled a comprehensive strategy that spanned web, email, ads, creative, social media, and texting.
      </p>

      <p>
        We took Fetterman’s clean logo and monotone black-and-white color scheme and turned it into a fun & engaging website and brand experience. Our creative team leaned into a bright yellow accent color (inspired by the Pittsburgh Steelers and Pirates, emphasizing Fetterman’s western Pennsylvania roots) and incorporated emojis and strong textures to bring Fetterman’s vibrant personality into the digital world. As we built out more creative collateral through ads, email, social, and web, we brought the witty and gritty tone of the campaign to life on digital.
